<!-- Question 5 -->

<!-- Write your own question and answer it :) -->

Why is `box-sizing: border-box` important to use? What does it do?

It forces the browser to put all content, including the padding and border itself, inside the specified box. Helps to make it easier to line up your content properly, without having to calculate for extra padding, etc.
