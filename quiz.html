<!-- Question 1 : HALF CORRECT -->

<!-- Question 2 : CORRECT -->

<!-- Need to correct the tabbing. New line to start <img>. -->

<!-- Question 3 : CORRECT -->

<!-- Question 4 : CORRECT, but not the preferred answer -->

<!-- Add something to the following html to distinguish just the middle greeting. Then write CSS to make all the greetings green-colored, and just the middle one blue-colored.  -->
<!-- Looking for a specific id for this greeting: <div class="greeting" id="japan"> -->
<!-- CSS would be div.greeting {} and then div.greeting#japan {}  -->
<!-- Should only use classes for things that apply multiple times and ids for things that only apply once -->

.greeting {
  color: green;
}

.middle-greeting {
  color: blue;
}

<div class="greeting">
  ni hao!
</div>

<div class="middle-greeting">
  konnichiwa!
</div>

<div class="greeting">
  annyeonghaseyo!
</div>


<!-- Question 5 -->

<!-- Write your own question and answer it :) -->

Why is `box-sizing: border-box` important to use? What does it do?

It forces the browser to put all content, including the padding and border itself, inside the specified box. Helps to make it easier to line up your content properly, without having to calculate for extra padding, etc.
